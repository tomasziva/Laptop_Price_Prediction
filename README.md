# Laptop Price Prediction
Predictive modelling assignment for laptop prices using Prallel Random Forest (Advanced Analytics in Business [D0S07a]/Big Data Platforms & Technologies [D0S06a], KU Leuven):

Purpose of this project was to determine price of the laptops, using information about features of the laptop (GPU and CPU details, brand, accessories, etc.). This assignment was also part of Kaggle type competition between student groups to construct model with best fitness (in terms of MAE on test set).

### Content 
1. Adding GPU details from external database (https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/), CPU detail featurization, laptop accessory featurization.
2. Analysis of missingness. Missing value imputation using mode, median or kNN imputation.
3. Analysis of multicollinearity and variable selection for modelling.
4. Cross-Validation setup
5. Model training using Gradient Boosting, Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Parallel Random Forest (preffered modelling technique at this point of time).
6. Model prediction and residual analysis.
7. Feature importance (or feature selection) using Boruta.
